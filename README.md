# Concert-Calendar

The intent of this project is to create an application that compiles concert information from multiple different venues, so instead of
having to search numerous sites, it is all found in one place.

The application uses Python and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). BeautifulSoup scrapes the websites
for the desired information and then the Python code inputs that into a database to be pulled from later.

Once the database receives all the necessary information, a web application will pull this information and place it into one complete 
calendar that can be filtered and searched.

# What is Complete?

The SQL database is complete. At this time one venues website is being scraped from and approximately half of the information is currently
being added to the database.

# What is Left to be Completed?

The rest of the information from the first venue needs to be scraped. Additional venues will be added and the web front-end will be 
designed.
